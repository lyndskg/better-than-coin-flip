# better-than-coin-flip

## Project Overview 

__**better-than-coin-flip**__ is a playful coding project that provides users with a whimsical solution to the age-old problem of indecisiveness. The project aims to help users make choices when they are indifferent or unable to decide between two options by offering a fun and entertaining alternative to a simple coin flip. 

Instead of leaving it all to chance, __**better-than-coin-flip**__ will use creative algorithms to generate a "nudge" or suggestion, adding a humorous twist to the decision-making process.

### Objective:
The main objective of __**better-than-coin-flip**__ is to offer users a lighthearted and unconventional way to break their indecisiveness and make choices between two options. By presenting amusing nudges, the project seeks to inject a dose of humor and creativity into everyday decision-making moments.


## Technologies & Programming Languages
To develop __**better-than-coin-flip**__, we can utilize a mix of technologies and programming languages that suit the project's needs:
1. **Python:** For its simplicity and ease of implementation.
2. **Flask:** To create a lightweight web application and user interface.
3. **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** For building an interactive and visually appealing user interface.

## Basic Workflow
1. **User Input:**
- The user will be presented with a simple web interface where they can input their two options (e.g., "Should I watch a movie or read a book?", "Should I have pizza or pasta for dinner?").
- There could be an optional textbox where the user can provide some context or additional information to add a fun twist to the nudge generation process.
2. **Nudge Generation:**
- __**better-than-coin-flip**__ will implement creative algorithms to generate nudges based on the user's input.
- These nudges can be amusing suggestions, random quotes, puns, jokes, or creative alternatives to the options presented.
3. **Display Nudge:**
- The generated nudge will be displayed on the user interface in a visually engaging manner.
- The user interface should be designed to evoke a sense of fun and playfulness.
4. **User Interaction:**
- The user will have the option to refresh the nudge or go back to the input screen for more decisions.
