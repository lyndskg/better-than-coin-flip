## Project Overview 


<a name="overview"></a>
<ins>__*better-than-coin-flip*__</ins> is a playful coding project that provides users with a whimsical solution to the age-old problem of indecisiveness. The project aims to help users make choices when they are indifferent or unable to decide between two options by offering a fun and entertaining alternative to a simple coin flip. 

Instead of leaving it all to chance, <ins>__*better-than-coin-flip*__</ins> will use creative algorithms to generate a "nudge" or suggestion, adding a humorous twist to the decision-making process.

## Basic Workflow
1. **User Input:**
- The user will be presented with a simple web interface where they can input their two options (e.g., "Should I watch a movie or read a book?", "Should I have pizza or pasta for dinner?").
- There could be an optional textbox where the user can provide some context or additional information to add a fun twist to the nudge generation process.
2. **Nudge Generation:**
- <ins>__*better-than-coin-flip*__</ins> will implement creative algorithms to generate nudges based on the user's input.
- These nudges can be amusing suggestions, random quotes, puns, jokes, or creative alternatives to the options presented.
3. **Display Nudge:**
- The generated nudge will be displayed on the user interface in a visually engaging manner.
- The user interface should be designed to evoke a sense of fun and playfulness.
4. **User Interaction:**
- The user will have the option to refresh the nudge or go back to the input screen for more decisions.
- There could be social media sharing options to let users share their amusing nudges with friends.
